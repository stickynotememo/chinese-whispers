# Chinese Whispers
A project to pass a string between as many languages as I know.

Has no practical purpose, but it's interesting to see how far I can push the idea. It's also teaching me a lot about IPC.

If you know any languages not on the list, please add them! Each file should be named n_[programming language], where n is the number of the program. It should take in a string, and append "Hello from [programming language].\n". It is your resonsibility to add appropriate output IPC to the previous file, so that it can interface with your program.

Chain of messages:

1. NASM x86_64 Assembly
2. C
3. Rust
4. Python

## Requirements
- Linux x86_64
- Python interpreter
